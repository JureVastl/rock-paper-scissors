Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors

- I have to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with javascript that will be played in the console for now.
- In a later stage i will revisit the project and make UI for the game.
- instructions for the project are : https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

- Game works in console as per project instructions. It is simple but I cant wait to revisit the project in the future to make an UI and do some proper styling.
